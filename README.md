Instructions and Code needed for WMT-16 Direct Assessment (DA)

The repo includes the bare bones example input/output for Appraise:

(a) example Mturk csv file (I will generate these & pass to CF)
(b) example image files (I will also generate these)
(c) example Mturk code that produces (d) 
(d) example MTurk batch file (I will need this back from Appraise)

(d) basically has is just the original csv file (a) above with 1 main variable added 
containing a large string with all the information needed to post-process a HIT. This
includes 
- information about each of the 100 translations (system, quality control info, sentence id);
- the scores given to each translation.
